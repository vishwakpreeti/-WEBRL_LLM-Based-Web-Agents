## 📚 Project Overview

WEBRL is a practical framework designed to train web agents to autonomously interact with real-world websites using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Azure OpenAI GPT-35-Turbo.  
It combines browser automation (Playwright) with a simulation dashboard (Streamlit) to dynamically perform web tasks such as product searches on Amazon India.

This project lays the foundation for integrating Reinforcement Learning concepts into autonomous web navigation.
